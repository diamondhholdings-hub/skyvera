| Telstra International Ltd | 1724805 | Jun 2025 | Jun 2026 | $34,641 | $43,301 | Q3'26 |
| Telstra International Ltd | 1724806 | Jun 2025 | Jun 2026 | $34,641 | $43,301 | Q3'26 |
| Telstra International Ltd | 1724904 | Jun 2025 | Jun 2026 | $34,641 | $43,301 | Q3'26 |
| **TOTAL** | | | | **$2,179,845** | **$2,724,806** | |

### 2.2 Contract Analysis

**Main Contract (Telstra Corporation Ltd):**
- Long-term engagement (Dec 2022 - May 2028) indicates strategic commitment
- 5+ year contract demonstrates deep integration into operations
- Renewal in "Next Year" (FY27) provides runway for relationship strengthening
- No AR aging issues - payment behavior excellent

**International Subscriptions (6 entities):**
- Newer engagement (Jun 2025) suggests recent expansion of CloudSense usage
- Shorter 1-year contracts with Q3'26 renewal - PRIORITY ATTENTION NEEDED
- Likely covers Telstra International operations across Asia-Pacific and global markets
- Pattern suggests standardized deployment across international entities

### 2.3 Revenue Concentration Analysis

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Telstra ARR | $2,179,845 | Largest customer |
| CloudSense Total ARR | $26,227,409 | |
| Telstra % of CloudSense | 8.3% | Significant but not dangerous concentration |
| Quarterly Revenue Impact | $544,961 | Material quarterly contribution |

**Risk Assessment:** While Telstra represents significant revenue, the 8.3% concentration is within acceptable limits for a strategic account. Loss would be material but not existential.

## 3. PRODUCT ALIGNMENT & VALUE PROPOSITION

### 3.1 What CloudSense Provides to Telstra

Based on CloudSense's capabilities and Telstra's confirmed usage:

**Primary Solution: Configure, Price, Quote (CPQ) & Commercial Order Management**

| Capability | Business Impact for Telstra |
|------------|---------------------------|
| Complex B2B Product Configuration | Streamline enterprise and government deals |
| Multi-site Quoting | Enable rapid configuration across thousands of customer sites |
| Salesforce-Native Platform | Unified CRM and sales operations |

**Sources:** [CloudSense Customers](https://www.cloudsense.com/customers), [CloudSense Dreamforce 2018](https://www.cloudsense.com/dreamforce-2018/)

### 3.2 Alignment with Telstra's Strategic Priorities

| Telstra Priority | CloudSense Alignment | Opportunity |
|------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Enterprise Business Reset | CPQ simplification reduces quote complexity | HIGH - Help reduce NAS portfolio complexity |
| B2B Digital Transformation | End-to-end digital sales journey | HIGH - Already deployed, expand usage |
| AI-First Strategy | CloudSense AI-powered CPQ (via TelcoDR) | MEDIUM - Introduce AI capabilities |
| Product Portfolio Simplification | Fewer products, faster configuration | HIGH - Support 2/3 reduction in product count |
| Cost Reduction ($350M target) | Automation reduces sales operations costs | HIGH - Quantify efficiency gains |

### 3.3 Current BSS Technology Ecosystem at Telstra

| Category | Vendor(s) | CloudSense Relationship |
|----------|-----------|------------------------|
| Enterprise Billing | CSG Singleview | Integration target |
| CRM | Salesforce | Native platform (strategic advantage) |
| Mediation | CSG Intermediate | Adjacent system |
| Billing (legacy) | Amdocs, Comverse | Legacy integration |
| Systems Integration | Accenture | Implementation partner overlap |

**Strategic Advantage:** CloudSense's Salesforce-native architecture gives it significant competitive advantage over non-native CPQ solutions in Telstra's environment.

## 4. COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

### 4.1 Telstra's Market Position

| Competitor | Mobile Share | Revenue Share | Notes |
|------------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| **Telstra** | 56.5% | 44% | Dominant incumbent |
| Optus (SingTel) | 23.9% | 31% | Strong #2 |
| TPG Telecom | 13.1% | 17% | Growing through Optus network sharing |
| Others | 6.5% | 8% | Aussie Broadband, Superloop gaining |

**Market Dynamics:**
- Australian telecom remains an oligopoly (92% revenue to Big 3)
- NBN market showing erosion - Big 3 losing ground to smaller ISPs
- TPG/Optus network sharing expanding competitive threat
- Price competition intensifying in enterprise market

### 4.2 Competitive Threats to CloudSense at Telstra

| Competitor | Threat Level | Rationale |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Amdocs** | HIGH | Already in Telstra ecosystem (billing), full BSS suite |
| **Ericsson** | MEDIUM | Strong OSS/BSS offering, 5G alignment |
| **Salesforce CPQ (native)** | MEDIUM-HIGH | Platform incumbency, may position as replacement |
| **MATRIXX Software** | LOW-MEDIUM | Cloud-native, but less B2B focus |
| **Netcracker (NEC)** | LOW | Strong in Asia but not dominant in Australia |

**Key Vulnerability:** Amdocs has deep relationships at Telstra and could position CPQ as part of broader BSS consolidation play.

**Defensive Strategy:**
1. Emphasize Salesforce-native advantage
2. Demonstrate AI capabilities (TelcoDR/Totogi integration)
3. Quantify ROI from existing deployment
4. Expand footprint before competitive RFP cycle

## 5. KEY STAKEHOLDERS

### 5.1 Executive Leadership Team

| Name | Title | Relevance | Engagement Priority |
|------|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Vicki Brady** | CEO & Managing Director | Strategic sponsor level | Executive briefing annually |
| **Shailin Sehgal** | Group Executive, Global Networks & Technology | Technology strategy | Technical roadmap alignment |
| **Michael Ackland** | Group Executive, Consumer & Small Business | Not primary target | Low |
| **Steven Worrall** | CEO, Telstra InfraCo | Infrastructure, Telstra International oversight | Medium - International expansion |

| **Leo Gagic** | Executive Director, Billing & Credit Management | Adjacent system owner (CSG) |

**Action Required:** Validate current organizational structure - positions may have changed since 2018. Nathan Bell and Ryan Harry are known advocates and should be re-engaged.

### 5.3 Organizational Structure Impact

Telstra's recent enterprise restructuring (May 2024) included:
- 2,800 job cuts (~10% of workforce)
- A$350M cost reduction target
- Simplified sales and service model
- NAS portfolio reduction by ~66%

**Implication:** Key contacts may have changed. Conduct stakeholder mapping exercise to identify current decision-makers.
