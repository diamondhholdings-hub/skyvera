**Prepared by:** Skyvera Customer Intelligence

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**HEALTH SCORE: 6.5/10**

| Dimension | Score | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Product Engagement | 6/10 | Single subscription, 100% recurring - stable but limited expansion |
| Financial Health | 7/10 | Parent company (VMO2) has significant revenue but negative credit outlook |
| Relationship Strength | 6/10 | Long-standing CPQ customer via O2/Telefonica heritage |
| Expansion Potential | 7/10 | Major B2B transformation (O2 Daisy) creates new opportunities |

**Key Finding:** Virgin Media Limited represents a strategically important account with moderate risk. The customer is navigating significant organizational transformation through the O2 Daisy B2B joint venture, workforce restructuring, and regulatory challenges. The CloudSense relationship originates from the O2/Telefonica side and serves CPQ needs. Primary risks include organizational disruption and potential BSS/OSS vendor consolidation. Expansion opportunities exist via the newly formed O2 Daisy B2B business unit.
