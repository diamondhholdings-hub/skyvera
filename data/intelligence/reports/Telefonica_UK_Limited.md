2. **B2B Segment:** Revenue Management consolidation (announced September 2022)

|-------------|------------|--------|
| Platform Consolidation | MEDIUM | Netcracker offers competing CPQ capabilities |
| B2B Billing Migration | HIGH | Revenue Management moving to Netcracker |
| Order-to-Cash Efficiency | MEDIUM | VMO2 targeting "single product catalog" |
| CIO Sponsorship | UNKNOWN | Adrian Di Meo (current CIO) quoted supporting Netcracker |

**Key CIO Quote (Risk Signal):**
> "Our multi-year digital transformation program is laying the foundation for our future success in supporting advanced services, higher levels of customer experience and more efficient operations. Netcracker has been part of this journey from the beginning."
> - Adrian Di Meo, CIO, Virgin Media O2

**Confidence Level:** MEDIUM - Based on public announcements; internal roadmap unknown.

## SECTION 4: ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES & RISK ASSESSMENT

### 4.1 Major Structural Changes (2024-2026)

| Change | Date | Impact on CloudSense |
|--------|------|---------------------|
| 2,000 job cuts (12% workforce) | July 2024 | Potential loss of champions |
| O2 Daisy B2B merger | August 2025 | New entity = new buying center |
| Fixed Wholesale redundancies (~300) | January 2026 | Organizational instability |
| Netcracker BSS transformation | Multi-year (ongoing) | Competitive threat |
| Mobile Transformation Plan | 2025 | Focus on network, not B2B systems |

### 4.2 O2 Daisy Analysis

**New Entity Overview:**
- **Pro Forma Revenue:** GBP 1.4 billion (~$1.8B)
- **EBITDA:** GBP 150 million (~$195M)
- **Ownership:** VMO2 70% / Daisy Group 30%
- **Chairman:** Matthew Riley (Daisy founder)
- **CEO:** Jo Bertram (former VMO2 Business MD)
- **Synergy Target:** GBP 600M NPV (~GBP 70M annual run-rate by 2030)

**CloudSense Opportunity/Risk:**
- **OPPORTUNITY:** O2 Daisy is a dedicated B2B entity requiring robust CPQ/order management
- **OPPORTUNITY:** Daisy brings unified comms/Microsoft products = product catalog expansion
- **RISK:** Daisy may bring competing systems or preferences
- **RISK:** Integration activity may delay investment decisions

### 4.3 Customer Health Score

| Dimension | Score (1-10) | Rationale |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| Product Engagement | 7/10 | Deep platform integration; multi-channel usage |
| Financial Health | 6/10 | Parent company stable but UK unit under pressure |
| Relationship Strength | 5/10 | Historical champion (O'Rourke) role unclear; new CIO aligned with Netcracker |
| Expansion Potential | 7/10 | O2 Daisy creates new opportunity; IoT/5G/AI use cases |
| **OVERALL HEALTH** | **6.3/10** | **MODERATE - Action Required** |

### 4.4 Churn Risk Assessment

**Churn Probability: MEDIUM-HIGH (35-45%)**

| Risk Factor | Weight | Score | Contribution |
|-------------|--------|-------|--------------|
| Competing BSS vendor (Netcracker) | 25% | 8/10 | 2.0 |
| Executive turnover/unknown champion | 20% | 7/10 | 1.4 |
| Organizational restructuring | 15% | 7/10 | 1.05 |
| Long tenure (15+ years) | 15% | 3/10 | 0.45 |
| Zero NRR (no new projects) | 15% | 8/10 | 1.2 |
| Industry consolidation pressure | 10% | 6/10 | 0.6 |
| **TOTAL RISK SCORE** | **100%** | -- | **6.7/10** |

**Early Warning Indicators:**
1. No Non-Recurring Revenue (NRR) in FY26 - indicates no new projects/expansions
2. CIO publicly championing Netcracker over CloudSense
3. Single subscription (no portfolio expansion)
4. 2,000+ workforce reduction may have impacted platform users
5. O2 Daisy may conduct technology audit as new entity

**Confidence Level:** MEDIUM - Churn risk model based on observable signals; internal sentiment unknown.
