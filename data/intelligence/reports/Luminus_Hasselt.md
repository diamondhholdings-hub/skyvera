## 6. OPPORTUNITIES

### 6.1 Expansion Opportunities

| Opportunity | Description | Revenue Potential | Probability | Timeline |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|----------|
| **25% Upsell (Planned)** | Already budgeted ARR growth | +$135,411 | HIGH (80%) | FY27 |
| **Luminus Solutions Expansion** | CPQ for energy services subsidiary | +$100K-200K | MEDIUM (45%) | FY27 |
| **Electric Mobility** | Product configuration for EV charging | +$50K-100K | MEDIUM (40%) | FY27-28 |
| **B2B Enterprise Growth** | Complex multi-site corporate quotes | +$75K-150K | MEDIUM (50%) | FY27 |
| **Partner Channel** | Reseller/partner quoting | +$50K-75K | LOW-MEDIUM (35%) | FY28 |
| **Belgium Market Reference** | Case study/reference value | Strategic | HIGH | FY26 |

**Total Upside Potential:** $400K - $650K additional ARR over 24 months (beyond planned 25% growth)

### 6.2 Strategic Expansion Drivers

**1. Luminus Solutions Subsidiary:**
Luminus Solutions is a subsidiary of Luminus and Dalkia (both EDF Group), focusing on:
- Energy efficiency solutions
- Facility management
- Mobile UPS installations
- Smart building solutions

This represents a separate business line that could benefit from CloudSense CPQ.

**2. Electric Mobility Growth:**
Luminus has deployed Odoo for electric mobility operations, but this could expand to need more sophisticated B2B quoting as the EV charging infrastructure scales.

**3. Energy Services Bundling:**
As Luminus moves from commodity energy to value-added services, product configuration complexity increases - exactly where CloudSense excels.

**4. Corporate/Enterprise Segment:**
Multi-site corporate customers with complex energy contracts, time-of-use pricing, and bundled services require sophisticated CPQ.

### 6.3 Strategic Value Beyond Revenue

| Value Driver | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Energy Vertical Reference** | Only energy customer in CloudSense top 25 (others: Centrica #9, Momentum Energy #37) |
| **Belgian Market Entry** | Reference for Benelux energy market expansion |
| **EDF Group Connection** | Potential entry point to broader EDF ecosystem |
| **European Energy Market** | Reference for EU energy transition digitalization |
| **Top Employer** | 11 consecutive years as Top Employer in Belgium (talent attraction) |

### 6.4 Cross-Sell to Other Skyvera Business Units

| Product | Fit Assessment | Notes |
|---------|----------------|-------|
| **Kandy (Communications)** | LOW | Luminus is energy company, not communications |
| **STL** | LOW | Different vertical focus |
| **NewNet** | LOW | Telecom network focus |

**Note:** Cross-sell opportunities to other Skyvera BUs are limited given Luminus's energy focus. However, Luminus could be a reference for other energy companies considering CloudSense.

### 6.5 Peer Customer Comparison

| Customer | ARR | Industry | Relevance |
|----------|-----|----------|-----------|
| **Centrica Services Ltd** | $1,053,983 | Energy (UK) | Peer - 2x Luminus ARR |
| **Luminus Hasselt NV/SA** | $541,643 | Energy (Belgium) | Target account |
| **Momentum Energy** | $240,684 | Energy (Australia) | Peer - 0.4x Luminus ARR |

**Insight:** Centrica (UK energy giant) is at 2x Luminus ARR. This suggests potential for Luminus expansion to match peer utilization levels. Centrica could provide a case study template.

## 7. RISKS

### 7.1 Risk Assessment Matrix

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **Technology Consolidation** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Strengthen Salesforce-native positioning, document ROI |
| **HCL Vendor Influence** | MEDIUM | LOW-MEDIUM | Ensure CloudSense not bundled into broader IT review |
| **Budget Pressure** | LOW-MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Quantify cost savings and sales acceleration |
| **Stakeholder Turnover** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Map multiple contacts, not single champion |
| **Competitive Displacement** | LOW | HIGH | Proactive account engagement, executive relationships |
| **EDF Group Standardization** | LOW | MEDIUM | Monitor parent company technology decisions |

### 7.2 Detailed Risk Analysis

**MEDIUM RISK - Technology Consolidation:**
Luminus has made significant technology investments:
- SAP migration to AWS (HCL)
- Salesforce CRM (core)
- Multiple specialized systems (Odigo, Odoo)

Risk: Future IT rationalization could question best-of-breed vs. platform bundling.

**Mitigation:**
1. Document Salesforce-native value proposition
2. Quantify specific energy vertical benefits
3. Ensure CloudSense is seen as core to Salesforce investment, not separate vendor

**MEDIUM RISK - HCL Vendor Influence:**
HCL has broad IT services mandate (2019-2024 contract). They could:
- Recommend consolidation to vendors they partner with
- Bundle alternative CPQ solutions
- Influence technology decisions

**Mitigation:**
1. Build direct relationships with business stakeholders (CCO, B2B Sales)
2. Position CloudSense as business solution, not IT project
3. Monitor HCL contract status and any renewal

**LOW RISK - EDF Group Standardization:**
EDF Group could mandate standard platforms across subsidiaries.

**Mitigation:**
1. Track EDF Group technology announcements
2. Engage with EDF Group stakeholders if appropriate
3. Ensure Luminus success story is known within EDF

### 7.3 Churn Risk Score: 2/10 (VERY LOW)

**Rationale:**
- Confirmed "Will Renew: Yes" for both subscriptions
- Projected 25% growth indicates expansion, not contraction
- Salesforce-native aligns with stated technology strategy
- No competitive signals detected
- Two active subscriptions indicate satisfactory adoption
- Strong parent company (EDF) provides financial stability

**Watchlist Items:**
1. Monitor for IT vendor consolidation announcements
2. Track any leadership changes in CCO/IT roles
3. Watch for EDF Group technology standardization moves
4. Ensure engagement beyond single contact
