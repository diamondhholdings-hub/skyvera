**Report Generated:** February 3, 2026
**Business Unit:** CloudSense
**Report Type:** Strategic Account Intelligence
**Analyst:** Athena Customer Intelligence System

---

## Executive Summary

Centrica Services Ltd is CloudSense's **#10 ranked customer** and represents a strategically important account in the UK energy sector. With **$1,053,983 ARR** (3.2% of CloudSense portfolio revenue), this account is part of the broader Centrica plc group - the parent company of British Gas, one of the UK's largest energy suppliers serving over 11 million customers.

### Overall Health Score: 7.4/10

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Product Engagement | 7/10 | Single active subscription; 100% recurring revenue indicates stable usage |
| Financial Health | 8/10 | Parent company Centrica plc is FTSE 100 listed with GBP 8.66B market cap; strong balance sheet |
| Relationship Strength | 6/10 | Stable account but requires deeper stakeholder mapping; potential champion turnover risk |
| Expansion Potential | 8/10 | Significant digital transformation investments; multi-divisional expansion possible |
| Renewal Confidence | 7/10 | Salesforce-native architecture aligns with tech stack; Vlocity/Salesforce Industries competition risk |

### Key Findings

1. **POSITIVE:** Centrica has committed GBP 4 billion in investment through 2028, with GBP 2.5 billion already deployed by H1 2025, including significant digital transformation initiatives. This creates budget headroom for technology investments. (High confidence)

2. **CAUTION:** British Gas deployed Vlocity Energy & Utilities Cloud (now Salesforce Industries) for I&C division with native CPQ capabilities. This represents a competitive threat to CloudSense's position. (High confidence)

3. **OPPORTUNITY:** Centrica Business Solutions serves 7,000+ organizations globally with B2B energy solutions. This presents cross-sell and expansion opportunities beyond the current CloudSense footprint. (Medium confidence)

4. **RISK:** Catherine O'Kelly, former MD of British Gas Energy, departed to Calisen Group in March 2025. Leadership turnover in customer-facing divisions creates relationship continuity risk. (High confidence)

## Technology Stack & Digital Infrastructure

### Enterprise Technology Environment

| Layer | Technology | Vendor | Relevance to CloudSense |
|-------|------------|--------|------------------------|
| CRM Platform | Salesforce | Salesforce | Core platform - CloudSense native integration advantage |
| CPQ (I&C Division) | Vlocity Energy & Utilities Cloud | Salesforce Industries | **COMPETITIVE THREAT** - Native Salesforce CPQ |
| Marketing Automation | Pardot | Salesforce | Integrated ecosystem |
| Service Cloud | Salesforce Service Cloud | Salesforce | Customer service platform |
| Marketing Cloud | Marketing Cloud | Salesforce | Campaign management |
| ERP | SAP S/4 HANA | SAP | Back-office operations (2018 go-live) |

| Cloud Infrastructure | AWS | Amazon | Primary cloud provider |
| Contact Center | AWS Connect | Amazon | Customer contact management |
| Customer Platform | ENSEK | Centrica-owned | New account management (acquired 2024) |

### Vlocity/Salesforce Industries Deployment (Key Competitive Intelligence)

British Gas Industrial & Commercial (I&C) division went live with **Vlocity Energy & Utilities Cloud** in 2019:

- **Results:** Quotations reduced from 3 days to 3 minutes
- **Implementation timeline:** 3 months go-live
- **Scope:** British Gas I&C business division

2. Different business units not served by Vlocity
3. Superior functionality for specific use cases
4. Integration with non-Salesforce systems
