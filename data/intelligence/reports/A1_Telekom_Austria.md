# A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA AG - STRATEGIC ACCOUNT PLAN
## CloudSense Business Unit | Skyvera
### Q1 2026 - Prepared February 2026

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Account:** A1 Telekom Austria AG (subsidiary of A1 Group / Telekom Austria AG)
**Status:** Mid-Tier Strategic Account - #15 Customer (by Revenue)
**Account Health Score:** 6/10 (Medium Confidence)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Revenue** | $760,823 |
| **Recurring Revenue (ARR)** | $550,574 |
| **Non-Recurring Revenue (NRR)** | $210,249 |
| **% of CloudSense Revenue** | 2.3% |
| **Active Subscriptions** | 2 |
| **NRR/Total Revenue Ratio** | 27.6% |
| **Renewal Risk** | MEDIUM |
| **Strategic Value** | HIGH |
| **Reference Value** | HIGH |

**Key Insight:** A1 Telekom Austria is a major Central and Eastern European telecommunications leader with strong financial performance and ongoing digital transformation initiatives. The account presents a CRITICAL RISK scenario due to their August 2024 selection of Amdocs for monetization platform modernization, which could signal a broader BSS/OSS vendor consolidation strategy. The 27.6% NRR ratio indicates significant professional services engagement, but the core CloudSense CPQ relationship requires defensive action to protect against competitive displacement.

**Urgent Action Required:** The Amdocs deal for billing, charging, and catalog consolidation represents a potential threat to CloudSense's commercial catalog and CPQ positioning. Immediate executive engagement recommended to understand scope boundaries and reinforce CloudSense's differentiated value in enterprise B2B sales.

## 2. CLOUDSENSE RELATIONSHIP ANALYSIS

### 2.1 Partnership Background

**Timeline:**
- **June 2019:** A1 Telekom Austria approached CloudSense
- **August 2019:** Full sales cycle completed in 8 weeks
- **Ongoing:** Active deployment and expansion

**Original Challenge:**
A1 Telekom Austria sought a platform to speed up quote time for large enterprise deals. Their complex B2B quotes consisted of thousands of product configurations, and they needed to cut quote time by at least one-third.

**Strategic Goals:**
- Move away from spreadsheets and dispersed product catalogs
- Automate and optimize the end-to-end sales journey
- Enable faster enterprise deal configuration
- Improve sales team productivity

**CloudSense Solution Deployed:**
- Commercial Product Catalog
- CPQ (Configure, Price, Quote)
- Order Management
- Document Generation
- Solution Management
- Deal Management
- Profit & Loss (including margin calculation)
- Orders & Subscriptions

**Documented Results:**
- Lead-to-order time cut by 25%
- Enabled fast configuration of large, sophisticated B2B deals
- "CloudSense plays a key role in the integrated modular and horizontal platform that is fundamentally changing the core of the whole business"

**Sources:** [CloudSense A1 Customer Story](https://www.cloudsense.com/customers/a1-telekom-austria), [Beyond Now Success Story](https://www.beyondnow.com/en/success/accelerating-a1-telekom-austrias-order-fulfillment-and-simplifying-complexity-through-oss-transformation/)

### 2.2 Subscription Structure

| Metric | Value | Analysis |
|--------|-------|----------|
| **Total Revenue** | $760,823 | Mid-tier account |
| **Recurring Revenue** | $550,574 | 72.4% of total |
| **Non-Recurring Revenue** | $210,249 | 27.6% of total |
| **Active Subscriptions** | 2 | Multiple deployments |
| **Customer Rank** | #15 | Top 20% of portfolio |
| **% of CloudSense** | 2.3% | Manageable concentration |

**Revenue Quality Analysis:**
- 72.4% recurring revenue indicates healthy subscription base
- 27.6% NRR suggests significant professional services engagement
- Two active subscriptions may indicate separate business unit deployments
- Ranking at #15 indicates strategic importance but not critical concentration risk

### 2.3 Revenue Concentration Analysis

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| A1 Total Revenue | $760,823 | #15 CloudSense customer |
| CloudSense Total ARR (est.) | ~$33 million | Based on budget data |
| A1 % of CloudSense | ~2.3% | Manageable concentration |
| Quarterly Revenue Impact | ~$190,000 | Material quarterly contribution |

**Risk Assessment:** At 2.3% of CloudSense revenue, A1 represents a meaningful but well-diversified account. Loss would be notable but manageable. However, strategic and reference value exceeds revenue contribution due to:
- Flagship European telco deployment
- Proven enterprise scale results
- Americas Movil connection (potential gateway to LATAM)

## 4. COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

### 4.1 A1's Market Position in Austria

| Competitor | Market Share (Q2 2024) | Strategy |
|------------|------------------------|----------|
| **A1 Austria** | 37.0% | Market leader, premium positioning |
| **Magenta Telekom** | 25.0% | Deutsche Telekom subsidiary, EUR 2B investment |
| **Drei Austria** | 21.0% | Hutchison, EUR 1.2B 5G investment |
| **MVNOs (Hot, Spusu)** | ~18.3% combined | Price-focused challengers |

**A1's Competitive Advantages:**
- Largest network infrastructure (76,500 km fiber)
- First 5G NR deployment in Austria (January 2020)
- Strong enterprise customer base
- America Movil backing for investment

### 4.2 CloudSense Competitive Threats

**CRITICAL THREAT: Amdocs Monetization Deal (August 2024)**

| Aspect | Detail | Risk Level |
|--------|--------|------------|
| **Deal Scope** | Billing, charging, catalog consolidation | HIGH |
| **Timeline** | Multi-year project | MEDIUM |
| **Overlap** | Commercial catalog potentially conflicts with CloudSense | HIGH |
| **Relationship** | 25-year Amdocs partnership | HIGH |
| **Platform** | Cloud-based, convergent monetization | MEDIUM |

**Amdocs Deal Specifics:**
- Selected August 2024 to modernize monetization platforms
- Multi-year project to future-proof billing, charging, and catalog
- Will consolidate monetization engines into "fully convergent platform"
- 25-year existing Amdocs partnership cited
- Support for 5G, IoT, and advanced service monetization

**Risk Analysis:**
The Amdocs deal represents the most significant competitive threat to CloudSense at A1:
1. **Catalog Overlap:** Amdocs catalog solution may overlap with CloudSense Commercial Product Catalog
2. **Vendor Consolidation:** Telcos often consolidate BSS vendors during transformation
3. **Budget Competition:** Major Amdocs investment may limit CloudSense expansion budget
4. **Executive Attention:** New CEO may favor simplification over best-of-breed

**Other CPQ/BSS Competitors:**
- Salesforce CPQ (native platform, but less telco-specific)
- Apttus/Conga (general CPQ)
- Vendavo (pricing-focused)
- PROS (AI-powered pricing)

### 4.3 Defensive Positioning

**CloudSense Differentiation vs. Amdocs:**

| Dimension | CloudSense | Amdocs |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| **Primary Focus** | B2B Enterprise Sales/CPQ | Billing/Charging/BSS |
| **Platform** | Salesforce-native | Proprietary |
| **Deployment** | Sales team enablement | Back-office operations |
| **Use Case** | Complex B2B quote configuration | Customer billing/charging |
| **Time-to-Value** | 8-week deployment demonstrated | Multi-year transformations |
| **User Base** | Sales, Pre-sales | Finance, Operations |

**Key Defensive Messages:**
1. "CloudSense is your B2B sales weapon; Amdocs is your billing engine - they're complementary"
2. "We've already delivered 25% lead-to-order reduction - that value continues"
3. "Salesforce-native means your sales team stays in their CRM, not a separate BSS system"
4. "Enterprise B2B configuration complexity is our specialty - Amdocs focuses on consumer monetization"

---

## 5. RISK ASSESSMENT

### 5.1 Risk Register

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Score | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|-------|------------|
| **Amdocs Displacement** | Medium (40%) | High | 8/10 | Executive engagement, scope clarification |
| **New CEO Relationship** | Medium (35%) | Medium | 6/10 | Immediate introduction meeting |
| **Budget Reallocation** | Medium (30%) | Medium | 5/10 | ROI reinforcement, case study refresh |
| **Champion Departure** | Low (20%) | Medium | 4/10 | Multi-threading stakeholders |
| **Vendor Consolidation** | Medium (35%) | High | 7/10 | Demonstrate Salesforce integration value |

### 5.2 Detailed Risk Analysis

**Risk 1: Amdocs Competitive Displacement (Probability: 40%, Impact: HIGH)**

*Evidence:*
- August 2024 Amdocs selection for monetization modernization
- "Catalog" specifically mentioned in Amdocs scope
- 25-year Amdocs relationship creates preference
- New CEO may seek vendor simplification

*Mitigation Strategy:*
1. Request meeting to understand Amdocs project scope boundaries
2. Position CloudSense as Salesforce-native B2B sales tool (different from BSS)
3. Reinforce proven 25% lead-to-order improvement
4. Document clear integration boundaries with Amdocs catalog

**Risk 2: New CEO Relationship Reset (Probability: 35%, Impact: MEDIUM)**

*Evidence:*
- Jiri Dvorjancansky appointed September 2025
- Previously led A1 Croatia/North Macedonia (different CloudSense exposure)
- May bring different vendor preferences from prior roles
- Marcus Grausam (27-year veteran, potential champion) departed

*Mitigation Strategy:*
1. Schedule executive introduction within 30 days
2. Prepare A1 Austria success story presentation
3. Offer business review with Martin Resel present
4. Investigate Dvorjancansky's prior vendor relationships

**Risk 3: Budget Reallocation (Probability: 30%, Impact: MEDIUM)**

*Evidence:*
- Major Amdocs investment underway
- Efficiency initiatives and cost focus
- Rising workforce and restructuring costs
- CAPEX priorities on network (5G/fiber)

*Mitigation Strategy:*
1. Position CloudSense as efficiency enabler, not cost center
2. Quantify ROI and ongoing value delivered
3. Propose multi-year contract for budget predictability
4. Identify cost savings from platform usage

### 5.3 Overall Churn Risk Assessment

**Churn Risk Score: 5.5/10 (MEDIUM)**

| Factor | Score | Weight | Weighted |
|--------|-------|--------|----------|
| Financial Health | 9/10 | 15% | 1.35 |
| Product Engagement | 7/10 | 20% | 1.40 |
| Competitive Threat | 4/10 | 25% | 1.00 |
| Leadership Stability | 5/10 | 15% | 0.75 |
| Strategic Alignment | 6/10 | 15% | 0.90 |
| Expansion Potential | 7/10 | 10% | 0.70 |
| **TOTAL** | | 100% | **5.5/10** |

**Interpretation:** Medium churn risk primarily driven by Amdocs competitive threat and leadership change. Financial health is excellent, but strategic vendor decisions during transformation period create uncertainty.

## 6. OPPORTUNITIES & GROWTH POTENTIAL

### 6.1 Expansion Opportunities

| Opportunity | Revenue Potential | Probability | Timeline |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|----------|
| **A1 Group Rollout** | $1.5-2.5M ARR | 30% | 12-24 months |
| **Additional Use Cases** | $150-300K ARR | 50% | 6-12 months |
| **Deeper Enterprise Integration** | $100-200K ARR | 60% | 6-9 months |
| **Professional Services** | $200-400K NRR | 70% | Ongoing |

### 6.2 Detailed Opportunity Analysis

**Opportunity 1: A1 Group Multi-Country Rollout**

*Rationale:*
- A1 operates in 7 countries (Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia, North Macedonia, Belarus)
- Jiri Dvorjancansky previously led Croatia and North Macedonia - potential champion for regional deployment
- America Movil may seek operational consistency across group
- Proven Austria deployment reduces risk for other markets

*Approach:*
1. Position regional deployment during new CEO introduction
2. Develop business case for Croatia (Dvorjancansky's former territory)
3. Identify Enterprise sales leaders in each country
4. Propose pilot for one additional market

*Estimated Value:* $1.5-2.5M additional ARR across 3-4 countries

**Opportunity 2: Enhanced B2B Use Cases**

*Rationale:*
- ICT solutions and managed services growing
- IoT and M2M monetization expanding
- Partner/reseller channel could benefit from CPQ

*Specific Use Cases:*
- IoT solution configuration
- Managed services quoting
- Partner portal for resellers
- Self-service B2B portal

*Estimated Value:* $150-300K additional ARR

**Opportunity 3: Americas Movil Gateway**

*Rationale:*
- America Movil is largest shareholder (~60%)
- Operates in 25 countries across Americas
- Successful A1 deployment could influence LATAM strategy
- CFO Carlos Garcia Moreno called A1 a "core investment"

*Approach:*
1. Document A1 success story for America Movil audiences
2. Identify America Movil technology decision makers
3. Propose executive briefing on CloudSense capabilities
4. Develop LATAM-specific value proposition

*Estimated Value:* Strategic (multi-million dollar potential if LATAM expansion)

### 6.3 Cross-Sell Opportunities (Other Skyvera BUs)

| Skyvera BU | Relevance | Opportunity |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Kandy** | Communications APIs | Low - A1 has internal capabilities |
| **STL** | Network software | Medium - OSS modernization ongoing |
| **NewNet** | Legacy systems | Low - Moving to modern platforms |

**Primary Focus:** Expand CloudSense footprint before considering cross-sell. STL could be relevant if OSS modernization creates opportunities.

## 8. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

### 8.1 Customer Lifetime Value Estimation

| Metric | Value | Assumption |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **Current ARR** | $550,574 | From customer data |
| **Annual NRR (Services)** | $210,249 | From customer data |
| **Estimated Tenure** | 5+ years | Partnership since 2019 |
| **Gross Margin** | ~70% | SaaS typical |
| **Expansion Potential** | +$500K ARR | Regional + use cases |
| **Estimated CLV** | $3.5-4.5M | Over 5 years |

### 8.2 Revenue at Risk

| Scenario | Revenue Impact | Probability | Expected Loss |
|----------|----------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Full Churn** | $760,823 | 10% | $76,082 |
| **Partial Displacement** | $300,000 | 25% | $75,000 |
| **Status Quo** | $0 | 50% | $0 |
| **Expansion** | +$200,000 | 15% | -$30,000 |
| **Expected Value** | | | **$121,082** |

**Interpretation:** Expected revenue at risk of ~$121K suggests defensive investment is warranted. The potential upside from expansion ($200K+) justifies proactive account investment.

### 8.3 Investment Recommendation

| Investment Type | Amount | Expected Return |
|-----------------|--------|-----------------|
| **Executive Travel** | $5,000 | Relationship protection |
| **Business Review** | $3,000 | Engagement strengthening |
| **Case Study Update** | $2,000 | Reference value |
| **Solutions Consulting** | $10,000 | Expansion enablement |
| **TOTAL** | **$20,000** | Protect $760K + enable $500K expansion |

**ROI Calculation:** $20K investment to protect $760K revenue and enable $500K expansion = 63:1 potential return.
