# Customer Intelligence Brief: One Albania

**Classification:** CRITICAL AT-RISK ACCOUNT
**Business Unit:** STL (Software Technology Labs)
**Generated:** February 3, 2026
**Analyst Confidence:** HIGH (multiple authoritative sources)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

One Albania is STL's flagship customer representing **47% of total STL revenue ($1.84M)** and ranked #1 in the business unit. The account is **CONFIRMED FOR NON-RENEWAL** in Q4'26, representing the single largest revenue loss event in STL's history. This churn is driven by strategic factors at the parent company level (4iG Group) rather than service dissatisfaction, making retention efforts extremely difficult.

**Critical Insight:** The decision not to renew the STL contract was made at the **4iG Group level in Hungary**, not at One Albania local management level. This is part of 4iG's broader strategy to consolidate IT/software development in-house as they transform from an IT systems integrator into an integrated telecommunications group.

## RELATIONSHIP SUMMARY

### Contract Details

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Current ARR** | $1,620,914.02 |
| **NRR (FY26)** | $218,000 |
| **Total Revenue** | $1,838,914.02 |
| **Contract Start** | December 1, 2023 |
| **Contract End** | November 30, 2026 |
| **Renewal Quarter** | Q4'26 |
| **Will Renew** | **NO** |
| **Projected ARR Post-Renewal** | $0 |
| **Active Subscriptions** | 1 |
| **Revenue Mix** | 88% RR / 12% NRR |

### Revenue Trajectory

| Quarter | Projected Revenue |
|---------|-------------------|
| Q4'25 | $0 (not in current quarter) |
| Q1'26 | $0 |
| Q2'26 | $0 |
| Q3'26 | $0 |
| Q4'26 | $270,892 (partial quarter before termination) |
| FY26 Total | ~$1,083,570 (declining to zero) |

### NRR Note (Critical)

The NRR component ($218K) includes professional services/consulting revenue with explicit notation:

> "Note: Will drop off in Q3/Q4 with 4iG move (4iG move not in fcst)"

This confirms the churn is related to 4iG's strategic consolidation of IT services.

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: WHY THEY ARE LEAVING

### Primary Churn Driver: 4iG In-Housing Strategy (High Confidence)

4iG Group is **not a traditional telecom company** - it originated as an IT systems integrator (founded 1990 as Freesoft Szoftverfejleszto) and maintains significant in-house software development capabilities. Their transformation strategy has three pillars:

1. **IT Systems** - Internal development and consulting
2. **Telecoms & Infrastructure** - Acquired telcos (Vodafone Hungary, One Albania, One Montenegro, etc.)
3. **Space & Defense** - Emerging vertical

As 4iG integrates its acquired telecom assets, they are consolidating software and IT services **internally** rather than relying on external vendors like STL. This is evidenced by:

- 4iG listing as an STL customer with $0 revenue (likely transitioned internally)
- Explicit notation about "4iG move" causing NRR drop-off
- 4iG's stated positioning as "leading IT system integrator in Hungary"

### Secondary Factors

1. **Regional Consolidation:** 4iG is creating unified "One" branded operations across Hungary, Albania, Montenegro, and Macedonia. This drives IT/software standardization at the group level.

2. **Cost Optimization:** With 8,000 employees across 28 subsidiaries, 4iG has scale to develop internally what they previously outsourced.

3. **Strategic Control:** As 4iG moves into enterprise services (5G private networks, cloud, data centers), they want IP control over enabling software.

### What STL Likely Provides

Based on STL's positioning as "Software Technology Labs" serving telecom customers, the $1.6M ARR contract likely covers:

- OSS/BSS components or customization
- Network management software
- Service delivery platform elements
- Custom telecom software development
- Systems integration services

## FINANCIAL IMPACT ANALYSIS

### Impact on STL Business Unit

| Metric | Current | Post-Churn | Change |
|--------|---------|------------|--------|
| One Albania Revenue | $1,838,914 | $0 | -$1,838,914 |
| % of STL BU | 47.4% | 0% | -47.4% |
| STL Total Revenue | $3,879,362 | $2,040,448 | -47.4% |

**Critical:** Losing One Albania will cut STL's revenue nearly in half, making it the smallest BU by a significant margin.

### STL Business Unit Health Context

From customer intelligence data:
- STL total ARR: $3,436,362
- STL projected ARR: $1,752,651
- **STL projected decline: -$1,683,711 (-49%)**
- At-risk customers: 13 of 20 (65%)
- At-risk ARR: $2,537,788

One Albania represents **64% of STL's at-risk ARR**.

### Revenue Recognition Timeline

| Period | Expected Revenue | Notes |
|--------|------------------|-------|
| Q1'26 | $399,677 | Full quarter |
| Q2'26 | $404,118 | Full quarter |
| Q3'26 | $408,559 | Full quarter |
| Q4'26 | $270,892 | Partial (ends Nov 30) |
| Q1'27+ | $0 | Contract terminated |

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### Churn Risk Score: 9/10 (CRITICAL)

| Risk Factor | Score | Rationale |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| Renewal Status | 10/10 | Explicitly marked "No" |
| Parent Company Strategy | 10/10 | Systematic in-housing of IT services |
| Decision Level | 9/10 | Made at 4iG Group, not local |
| Contract Duration | 8/10 | Only 10 months remaining |
| Champion Access | 8/10 | Decision makers in Hungary, not Albania |
| Competitive Pressure | 9/10 | Internal 4iG capabilities compete |
| Relationship Strength | 3/10 | Transactional, not strategic |

### Risk Mitigation Assessment

**Probability of Retention: <5%**

The decision to move IT services in-house is strategic and systematic across 4iG's portfolio. This is not a price, service quality, or relationship issue that can be addressed through typical retention tactics.

### AR/Collection Risk

One Albania is **NOT** in the AR >90 days list, indicating:
- No outstanding payment issues
- Professional commercial relationship
- Clean exit expected

---

## STRATEGIC OPTIONS ANALYSIS

### Option 1: Accept Loss, Maximize Exit Value (RECOMMENDED)

**Actions:**
1. Ensure full revenue collection through contract end (Nov 30, 2026)
2. Negotiate clean transition with documentation/knowledge transfer
3. Request case study or reference rights before departure
4. Explore "alumni" pricing for any future point needs

**Expected Outcome:** $0 saved, but clean relationship for future opportunities

### Option 2: Executive Escalation to 4iG Group

**Actions:**
1. Engage Peter Fekete (CEO) or Gellert Jaszai (Chairman) at 4iG
2. Propose strategic partnership positioning vs. vendor relationship
3. Offer regional expansion support across 4iG portfolio

**Assessment:** LOW probability of success (<10%). 4iG's in-housing strategy is core to their transformation thesis. However, this approach could preserve relationship for future selective engagement.

**Risk:** Could accelerate departure or damage relationship if perceived as desperate.

### Option 3: Pivot to 4iG Group Relationship

**Rationale:** 4iG is already listed as an STL customer (currently $0). Rather than fighting One Albania churn, explore whether STL capabilities can serve 4iG Group's broader portfolio:

- One Hungary (largest market)
- One Montenegro
- One Macedonia
- Future acquisitions

**Actions:**
1. Map STL capabilities against 4iG Group's three pillars
2. Identify gaps in 4iG's in-house capabilities
3. Propose selective engagement on specialized/niche solutions
4. Position as "capacity partner" during M&A integration periods

**Assessment:** MEDIUM probability of partial recovery (20-30%). Worth pursuing as a parallel track.

## OPPORTUNITIES (LIMITED)

### Potential 4iG Group Engagement Areas

| Opportunity | Description | Probability | Potential Value |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| M&A Integration Support | Provide temporary capacity during 4iG acquisitions | 25% | $200-500K/event |
| Specialized Solutions | Niche capabilities 4iG won't build in-house | 15% | $100-300K ARR |
| Regional Expansion | Support new market entries (North Macedonia, etc.) | 10% | $50-200K |
| Training/Knowledge Transfer | Help 4iG build internal capabilities | 30% | $50-100K NRR |

**Total Opportunity Value:** $400K-1.1M (vs. $1.8M loss)

### Cross-Sell to Other BUs

One Albania/4iG profile suggests potential fit with:

- **Cloudsense:** CPQ/Quote-to-Cash for telecom (if not in-housed) - LOW probability
- **Kandy:** CPaaS/Communications APIs - LOW probability (4iG building internally)
- **NewNet:** Network solutions - LOW probability

**Assessment:** 4iG's in-housing strategy applies across all solution categories. Cross-sell probability is low.

---

## KEY FINDINGS SUMMARY

1. **CONFIRMED LOSS:** One Albania ($1.84M, 47% of STL) will not renew in Q4'26. This is a strategic decision at the 4iG Group level, not a service or relationship issue.

2. **ROOT CAUSE:** 4iG Group is transforming from an IT systems integrator into an integrated telecommunications company. They are systematically in-housing software and IT capabilities across their acquired telecom portfolio.

3. **MINIMAL RETENTION OPPORTUNITY:** Traditional retention tactics (pricing, service improvements, executive engagement) have <5% probability of success. The decision is strategic and systematic.

4. **STL BU IMPACT:** This single loss will cut STL revenue by 47%, making it the smallest and most at-risk business unit. Combined with other at-risk accounts, STL faces a -49% ARR decline.

5. **PARTIAL RECOVERY PATH:** Pivoting to a 4iG Group relationship as a "capacity partner" offers 20-30% probability of recovering $400K-1.1M of value, but requires executive-level engagement in Hungary.

6. **CLEAN EXIT EXPECTED:** No AR issues or relationship problems. Professional transition is achievable.
