## STRATEGIC INTELLIGENCE

### Why HCL May Be Churning (Hypothesis Analysis)

#### 1. Internal Build vs. Buy Shift (HIGH CONFIDENCE)

HCL Technologies has made significant investments in acquiring telecom messaging and network capabilities:

- **December 2025:** HCLTech signed agreement to acquire HPE's Telco Solutions business
  - Gains Operations Support Systems (OSS), Home Subscriber Server (HSS), and 5G Subscriber Data Management capabilities
  - Supports 1+ billion devices across 200+ deployments globally
  - Nearly 1,500 engineering and telecom specialists joining HCLTech

- **May 2024:** Acquired select assets of HPE Communications Technology Group for $225 million

- **January 2025:** Partnership with Vodafone Idea for HCL Augmented Network Automation (HCL ANA)

**Implication:** HCL is systematically building internal telecom software capabilities. They may view NewNet's messaging/telecom products as something they can now deliver in-house or through acquired capabilities.

#### 2. Global Restructuring Program (MEDIUM CONFIDENCE)

HCLTech CEO C. Vijayakumar announced a restructuring program for FY26:

- Focus on facilities and teams **outside India**
- "Talent ramp-down in geographies outside India"
- Playing out across Q2, Q3, and Q4 FY26
- Aiming to return to 18-19% EBIT margins

**Implication:** UK operations may be under cost scrutiny. Vendor consolidation and cost optimization are priorities. NewNet subscription may be viewed as a cost to eliminate.

#### 3. Vendor Consolidation Trend (MEDIUM CONFIDENCE)

From HCL's own deals, they are winning vendor consolidation contracts from other enterprises:
- "Vendor consolidation for an F100 US insurance firm"
- Managing "churn in traditional providers"

**Implication:** HCL understands vendor consolidation dynamics and may be applying the same logic to their own vendor relationships.

#### 4. H-1B Visa and Delivery Model Changes (LOW CONFIDENCE)

HCL is "strategically strengthening global delivery model and reducing reliance on visas" following US H-1B fee increases.

**Implication:** Shifts in service delivery models may affect how they value third-party software subscriptions.

## COMPETITIVE THREAT ANALYSIS

### HCL's Growing Telecom Capabilities

HCL Technologies is systematically becoming a telecom software competitor:

| Capability | Source | Relevance to NewNet |
|------------|--------|---------------------|
| SMSC/Messaging Infrastructure | HPE Telco Solutions acquisition | Direct competition |
| Network Automation | HCL ANA platform | Adjacent capability |
| OSS/BSS Systems | HPE acquisitions | Telecom infrastructure |
| 5G SDM | HPE Telco Solutions | Next-gen messaging |
| AI-led Network Solutions | In-house development | Platform enhancement |

**Strategic Assessment:** HCL is transforming from a services company to a telecom software platform provider. NewNet's messaging solutions may become redundant to HCL's portfolio.

### Market Context

- HCL serves 50+ telecom clients globally
- Major relationships with Verizon Business ($2.1B deal), Vodafone Idea
- Engineering and R&D Services segment is a key growth area
- "AI-led autonomous networking" is strategic priority

---

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### Churn Risk: 9/10 (CRITICAL)

| Risk Factor | Severity | Mitigation Difficulty |
|-------------|----------|----------------------|
| Confirmed non-renewal status | Critical | Very High |
| Strategic capability acquisition | High | Very High |
| Global restructuring underway | High | Moderate |
| Short time to renewal (Q2'26) | High | High |
| Lack of expansion history | Medium | Moderate |

### Impact Analysis

**If HCL Churns:**
- NewNet loses $2,082,880 ARR (29.9% of business unit)
- Combined with other at-risk accounts, NewNet faces $2.4M at-risk ARR (34.3% of BU)
- Significant revenue headwind for Skyvera overall

**Revenue Impact Timeline:**
- Q1'26: Full revenue recognized (contract through March 31)
- Q2'26: $0 revenue from HCL
- Q3'26+: Ongoing $520K/quarter revenue gap
