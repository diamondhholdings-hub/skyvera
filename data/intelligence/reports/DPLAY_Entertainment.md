# Customer Intelligence Brief: DPLAY Entertainment Ltd

**Report Date:** February 3, 2026
**Business Unit:** CloudSense
**Customer Rank:** #9 of Top CloudSense Customers
**Classification:** CONFIDENTIAL - Internal Use Only

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

DPLAY Entertainment Limited is a UK-registered subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) that operates the Discovery+ streaming service in the United Kingdom and Ireland. With $1.23M total revenue (35% recurring / 65% non-recurring), this account represents a unique opportunity tied to one of the most significant corporate restructurings in media history.

**Critical Context:** Warner Bros. Discovery announced in December 2025 a definitive agreement to be acquired by Netflix for $82.7B enterprise value. Under this deal, Discovery+ will NOT be part of the Netflix acquisition but will instead become part of the newly spun-off "Discovery Global" entity expected to complete separation in Q3 2026. This corporate transformation creates both significant risks and strategic opportunities for the CloudSense relationship.

## HEALTH SCORE: 6/10

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Product Engagement | 6/10 | Active subscription (1), but high NRR ratio suggests project-based engagement |
| Financial Health | 7/10 | Parent WBD has 128M streaming subscribers; strong streaming growth |
| Relationship Strength | 5/10 | Limited visibility into stakeholder relationships; corporate restructuring underway |
| Expansion Potential | 6/10 | Discovery Global spin-off may create new opportunities; European expansion possible |

**Overall Assessment:** Medium confidence. The account is stable but faces significant corporate uncertainty due to the WBD-Netflix transaction and Discovery Global spin-off.

## CORPORATE TRANSFORMATION: Critical Risk Factor

- **Enterprise Value:** $82.7 billion
- **Equity Value:** $72.0 billion
- **Per Share:** $27.75 (all-cash, amended January 2026)

**Critical: Discovery+ is NOT included in the Netflix deal.**

### Discovery Global Spin-Off

**Discovery Global Assets:**
- Discovery+ streaming service (globally)
- CNN
- TNT Sports (US)

## ACCOUNT FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

### Revenue Breakdown

| Revenue Type | Amount | % of Total | Notes |
|--------------|--------|------------|-------|
| Recurring Revenue (ARR) | $427,661 | 34.8% | Subscription-based |
| Non-Recurring Revenue (FY26) | $800,000 | 65.2% | Professional services/implementation |
| **Total Revenue** | **$1,227,661** | **100%** | |

### Revenue Analysis

**High NRR Ratio (65%) Indicates:**

3. Customization or integration work
4. Potential transition to higher ARR upon completion

**Risk:** If NRR represents a one-time project, revenue may decline significantly in future periods unless converted to recurring.

**Opportunity:** Successful NRR project completion could lead to ARR expansion and reference value.

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### Churn Risk Score: 6/10 (MEDIUM-HIGH)

| Risk Factor | Score | Rationale |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| Corporate Restructuring | 8/10 | Netflix acquisition + Discovery Global spin-off creates extreme uncertainty |
| Contract Renewal Timing | 6/10 | Unknown renewal date; likely reviewed during separation |

| Competitive Displacement | 5/10 | Tech consolidation possible but not imminent |
| Champion Risk | 6/10 | Leadership changes during separation |
| Technology Migration | 5/10 | No signals but separation could trigger review |

- Position CloudSense as essential infrastructure for Discovery+ operations
- Document business value and ROI for new leadership

- Cost-cutting likely priority for new entity
- Vendor consolidation probable

**Mitigation:**

**Bottom Line:**
- **Short-term (0-6 months):** Focus on protecting the existing relationship, documenting value, and establishing contacts with emerging Discovery Global leadership
- **Medium-term (6-12 months):** Position for contract renewal/extension ahead of corporate separation; explore expansion opportunities
- **Long-term (12+ months):** Pursue Discovery Global multi-geography expansion; establish CloudSense as strategic infrastructure partner

**Overall Recommendation:** HOLD and INVEST SELECTIVELY. This account requires proactive engagement to navigate corporate uncertainty, but offers significant upside if CloudSense can establish itself as a critical partner for the Discovery Global transition.
