---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Spotify represents a **high-value, strategically significant** CloudSense customer with strong retention fundamentals but limited near-term expansion potential. As a global technology leader with $18.6B in trailing revenue and 713M monthly active users, Spotify's use of CloudSense CPQ for their advertising business operations positions this account at the intersection of media and telecommunications verticals where CloudSense excels.

**Key Verdict:** RETAIN with MODERATE EXPANSION OPPORTUNITY. Focus on deepening platform adoption within Spotify Advertising and exploring new use cases as their B2B advertising marketplace scales.

## 3. PRODUCT & TECHNOLOGY ENVIRONMENT

### Current Tech Stack (High Confidence)

| Layer | Technology | CloudSense Integration Point |
|-------|------------|------------------------------|
| **Cloud Infrastructure** | Google Cloud Platform (GCP) | N/A |
| **CRM** | Salesforce Sales Cloud | **Direct Integration** |
| **Collaboration** | Slack (Salesforce-integrated) | Workflow triggers |
| **Marketing Automation** | Salesforce Marketing Cloud | Campaign data |
| **Data Warehouse** | BigQuery | Analytics |

| **Container Orchestration** | Kubernetes, Docker | Infrastructure |
| **Monitoring** | Prometheus, Grafana | Operations |
| **IaC** | Terraform | Infrastructure |

### Salesforce Ecosystem Depth (Critical for CloudSense)

Spotify Advertising has a **deep Salesforce investment** (HIGH CONFIDENCE):
- Sales Cloud for opportunity and pipeline management
- Marketing Cloud for campaign journeys
- Slack integration for 20+ automated workflows
- 95% reduction in campaign data access time (6 months to 7 days)
- Unified view of ad inventory through Sales Cloud

**Strategic Implication:** CloudSense's Salesforce-native architecture is well-aligned with Spotify's technology strategy. This creates **high switching costs** and natural platform stickiness.

|-------|---------------------|
| **AI Investment** | Spotify building AI research lab; new AI-powered tools. CloudSense AI-powered CPQ features align well. |
| **Programmatic Advertising Growth** | Spotify Ad Exchange (SAX) launched April 2025. May drive need for more sophisticated CPQ rules and pricing. |
| **Partner Ecosystem Expansion** | Amazon DSP, Yahoo DSP, Smartly integrations. Potential for partner portal CPQ needs. |
| **Cost Discipline Culture** | Post-layoff focus on efficiency. CloudSense must demonstrate clear ROI. |

**Estimated Value:** $150,000-$250,000 additional ARR
**Probability:** Medium-Low (40%)

---

## 7. COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE & DISPLACEMENT RISK

### CPQ Competitive Alternatives

| Competitor | Fit for Spotify | Displacement Risk |
|------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Salesforce CPQ (Native)** | High - Already Salesforce shop | MEDIUM - Most credible alternative |
| **DealHub** | Medium - Strong in SaaS | LOW - Less telco/media expertise |
| **Conga** | Medium - Document focus | LOW |
| **Oracle CPQ** | Low - Not Salesforce-native | VERY LOW |
| **Vendavo** | Medium - Pricing focus | LOW |

### Competitive Defense Strategy

**Primary Threat:** Salesforce CPQ (native Salesforce product)

**Defense Points:**
1. CloudSense's deep telecommunications/media vertical expertise vs. Salesforce CPQ's horizontal approach
2. Order Management capabilities beyond basic CPQ
3. Complex product catalog handling for advertising inventory
4. Proven media company implementations (BT, Vodafone, etc.)
5. Existing integration and institutional knowledge

**Vulnerability:** If Spotify consolidates all Salesforce spending for volume discounts, Salesforce could bundle CPQ at aggressive pricing.

**Recommendation:** Proactive engagement with Salesforce account team to position as complementary rather than competitive.
