## FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

### Revenue Breakdown (FY26 Projection)

| Quarter | Revenue | % of Total | Status |
|---------|---------|------------|--------|
| Q1'26 | $328,000 | 39.3% | Projected |
| Q2'26 | $212,000 | 25.4% | Projected |
| Q3'26 | $229,000 | 27.5% | Projected |
| Q4'26 | $65,000 | 7.8% | Projected |
| **Total FY26** | **$834,000** | **100%** | - |

### Revenue Pattern Analysis

**Key Observation:** Revenue is significantly front-loaded with Q1 representing 39% of annual revenue, declining sharply to just 8% in Q4. This pattern strongly suggests:

1. **Implementation Project:** Classic PS engagement curve with heavy upfront discovery, design, and build phases
2. **Go-Live Expected Q3/Q4:** The Q3 spike ($229K) likely represents final implementation push before go-live
3. **Post-Go-Live Support:** Q4's $65K likely represents warranty/hypercare support period

**Internal Note:** Per budget notes - "TR: signings are higher, this is recognized revenue. based on factored pipeline from SFDC" - indicates this is a conservative forecast with upside potential.

### Peer Comparison (CloudSense Consulting NRR - FY26)

| Customer | 4Q Total | Rank |
|----------|----------|------|
| New Sales Ps - <Masergy> | $1,924,000 | 1 |
| Liquid Telecom | $1,416,000 | 2 |
| **New Sales Ps - Go Get** | **$834,000** | **3** |
| Dplay Entertainment Ltd | $800,000 | 4 |
| New Sales Ps - <Telstra - Ges(a)> | $431,900 | 5 |
| New Sales Ps - <Star Hub> | $300,000 | 6 |

**Rank:** #3 largest CloudSense Consulting engagement by FY26 revenue

## STRATEGIC ANALYSIS

### Why GoGet Chose CloudSense

**Hypothesis (Medium Confidence):** GoGet is implementing CloudSense CPQ to:

1. **B2B Sales Transformation:** Manage complex corporate fleet/mobility contracts with enterprise customers
2. **Product Configuration:** Configure custom mobility packages (vehicle types, locations, usage tiers)
3. **Salesforce Native:** GoGet likely already uses Salesforce CRM; CloudSense's native integration reduces complexity
4. **Subscription Management:** Handle recurring membership billing and contract renewals

### Market Expansion Significance

**This engagement represents CloudSense's expansion beyond traditional telco/media verticals into:**

- Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS)
- Sharing economy platforms
- Consumer services with B2B enterprise sales

**Strategic Value:** Validates CloudSense CPQ applicability for subscription-based, usage-metered business models beyond telecommunications.

## OPPORTUNITY ASSESSMENT

### Expansion Potential: HIGH

#### 1. Recurring Revenue Conversion (Estimated: $150K-$300K ARR)

Post-implementation, GoGet will require ongoing CloudSense licensing. Based on CloudSense pricing benchmarks ($500-$1,000/user/month) and estimated sales team size:

| Scenario | Users | Monthly | Annual ARR |
|----------|-------|---------|------------|
| Conservative | 15-20 | $12,500 | $150,000 |
| Base Case | 25-30 | $20,000 | $240,000 |
| Upside | 40+ | $30,000 | $360,000 |

**Timing:** Target RR discussions in Q3'26 as implementation nears completion

#### 2. Phase 2 Expansion Services

Potential additional PS engagements:
- Order Management implementation
- Commerce/Digital storefront integration
- Advanced analytics/reporting
- Regional expansion (NZ, Southeast Asia)

**Estimated Value:** $200K-$500K additional NRR

#### 3. Reference Customer Value

GoGet would be CloudSense's flagship non-telco customer, valuable for:
- Case study development
- Conference speaking opportunities
- Analyst briefings on market expansion
- Sales enablement for MaaS/mobility vertical

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### Risk 1: Project Scope Reduction (Medium Risk)

**Signal:** Sharp Q4 revenue decline ($229K to $65K) could indicate:
- Original scope has been reduced
- Customer budget constraints
- Faster-than-expected implementation completion

**Mitigation:** Engage customer success early to confirm project timeline and identify expansion opportunities

### Risk 2: No Recurring Revenue Conversion (Medium Risk)

**Signal:** 100% NRR engagement with no visible RR in budget

**Mitigation:**
- Build relationship with Tom Davey (CEO) and Jack Fahey (CFO) for licensing discussions
- Position CloudSense as strategic platform, not one-time project
- Develop ROI business case for ongoing platform investment

### Risk 3: Customer Financial Stability (Low Risk)

**Assessment:**
- GoGet has $35M revenue, market leadership position, and PE backing
- Competitor exit (Uber Carshare) strengthens market position
- Growth tailwinds from corporate mobility programs and sustainability trends

**Confidence Level:** High - Multiple sources confirm financial stability

### Risk 4: Implementation Failure (Low Risk)

**Assessment:**
- CloudSense has 100+ successful implementations
- Project appears well-scoped with clear quarterly milestones
- Internal note suggests pipeline confidence ("signings are higher")

---

## KEY FINDINGS

### 1. New Vertical Penetration
GoGet represents CloudSense's expansion into mobility/sharing economy - validates CPQ applicability beyond telco. **Strategic importance: HIGH**

### 2. Strong RR Conversion Opportunity
$834K PS engagement creates natural path to $150K-$300K ARR post-go-live. Must be proactively managed. **Revenue impact: MEDIUM-HIGH**

### 3. Revenue Trajectory Concern
Q4 cliff ($65K vs. Q1's $328K) warrants investigation - may indicate scope change or project acceleration.

### 4. Reference Customer Potential
Market-leading Australian company with strong brand recognition. Valuable for CloudSense market expansion narrative.
