# Customer Intelligence Report: Foxtel Management Pty Limited

**Report Generated:** February 3, 2026
**Business Unit:** CloudSense
**Report Type:** Strategic Account Intelligence
**Analyst:** Athena Customer Intelligence System

---

## Executive Summary

Foxtel Management Pty Limited is CloudSense's **#17 ranked customer** and represents a **strategic media & entertainment account** in the APAC region. With **$640,261 ARR** (1.98% of CloudSense portfolio revenue) and a projected expansion to **$800,326 ARR** (25% growth), this account presents both significant opportunity and notable risk given the recent DAZN acquisition.

### Overall Health Score: 6.8/10

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Product Engagement | 7/10 | Single active subscription; stable CPQ deployment for subscription management |
| Financial Health | 7/10 | Part of $3.4B DAZN acquisition; parent company financially strong |
| Relationship Strength | 6/10 | Uncertainty due to ownership change and executive restructuring |
| Expansion Potential | 7/10 | Platform consolidation (BINGE as hub) creates CPQ complexity opportunities |
| Renewal Confidence | 7/10 | "Yes" renewal status but monitor post-acquisition technology decisions |

### Key Findings

1. **CRITICAL - OWNERSHIP CHANGE:** DAZN completed acquisition of Foxtel on April 2, 2025 for $3.4B. News Corp and Telstra retain 6% and 3% minority stakes in DAZN respectively. This fundamentally changes the strategic context. (High confidence)

2. **POSITIVE:** Foxtel's streaming transformation is accelerating - Kayo subscribers up 9% YoY, streaming now represents 69% of total subscribers (4.658M total). BINGE being positioned as consolidated entertainment hub creates product complexity requiring robust CPQ. (High confidence)

3. **OPPORTUNITY:** Platform consolidation (retiring FLASH and LifeStyle apps into BINGE) and expanded content offerings (sports, news added to BINGE) create subscription packaging complexity ideal for CloudSense CPQ capabilities. (Medium-High confidence)

4. **RISK:** Executive restructuring under DAZN ownership announced May 2025. Key departures and new reporting structures may affect CloudSense relationship ownership. (High confidence)

5. **STRATEGIC CONNECTION:** Foxtel was partially owned by Telstra (35% stake sold). CloudSense serves both Telstra ($1.97M ARR, #3) and Foxtel ($640K ARR, #17) - combined APAC media/telco relationship value of $2.6M+ ARR. (High confidence)
