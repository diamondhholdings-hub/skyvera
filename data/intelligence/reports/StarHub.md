| **1H2025 Service Revenue** | S$976.1 million | +3.0% |

**Confidence Level:** HIGH (Based on official company filings)

### Quarterly Earnings Trend (FY2025)

| Quarter | Net Profit | YoY Change | Commentary |
|---------|------------|------------|------------|
| Q1 2025 | S$31.8M | -18.4% | Service revenue down 0.7% due to mobile/entertainment weakness |
| Q2 2025 | S$30.2M | - | Excluding S$14.1M one-off spectrum forfeiture payment |
| Q3 2025 | S$26.2M | -35.3% | Steep decline reflecting competitive pressures |
| **9M2025** | S$88.2M | -25.0% | Excluding non-recurring items |

**Key Insight:** While revenue is stable, profitability is under significant pressure in FY2025. The -35.3% YoY earnings decline in Q3 2025 signals margin compression from competitive dynamics and investment costs.

## STRATEGIC CONTEXT

### DARE+ Transformation Program

StarHub is in the midst of a multi-year digital transformation initiative called DARE+ (launched 2022):

| Phase | Timeline | Investment | Savings |
|-------|----------|------------|---------|
| **DARE 1.0** | Completed Oct 2021 | - | S$270M in cost savings; 15% OpEx reduction |
| **DARE+** | 2022-2026 | Build phase completing 1H2025 | Target: S$280M savings, S$220M gross profit boost |
| **New Cost Programme** | FY2026-FY2028 | - | Target: S$60M additional savings |

**Key Pillars:** Legacy decommissioning, network automation, systems re-architecture, business simplification

**Implication for CloudSense:** CloudSense is part of the "systems re-architecture" pillar. Any platform consolidation creates both opportunity (expansion) and risk (vendor review).

## COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

### Singapore Telecom Market

| Operator | Position | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Singtel** | #1 | Largest, former state monopoly, regional giant |
| **StarHub** | #2 | Focus on convergence and enterprise |
| **M1** | #3 | Being sold to SIMBA Telecom (S$1.43B deal announced Aug 2025) |
| **SIMBA (TPG)** | #4 | Price disruptor; acquiring M1 |

### Competitive Dynamics

- Singapore telco market is consolidating (M1-SIMBA deal, StarHub-MyRepublic)
- Intense price competition in mobile segment
- StarHub differentiating through enterprise focus and cybersecurity
- CEO Eapen: "Smaller players may find it harder to sustain, especially without robust platforms"

### StarHub Competitive Position

- Multi-brand broadband strategy (StarHub + MyRepublic)
- Digital transformation leadership
- Low leverage balance sheet

**Weaknesses:**
- Declining mobile and entertainment revenues
- Earnings under pressure (Q3 2025 -35.3% YoY)
- Smaller scale than Singtel

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### Risk Matrix

| Risk Category | Risk Level | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|---------------|------------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Churn Risk** | LOW | 15% | HIGH | Deep integration, expanding footprint |
| **Competitive Displacement** | LOW | 10% | HIGH | Telco-specific capabilities, Salesforce-native |
| **Budget Cuts** | MEDIUM | 35% | MEDIUM | Cost optimization program may pressure vendor spend |
| **Technology Migration** | LOW | 15% | HIGH | Cloud Infinity uses different stack but CloudSense is Salesforce-native |
| **Champion Departure** | MEDIUM | 25% | MEDIUM | Identify and map additional stakeholders |
| **Earnings Pressure** | HIGH | 70% | LOW-MEDIUM | May delay expansion but unlikely to cancel existing |

### Churn Risk Score: 2.5/10 (LOW)

**Rationale:**
1. CloudSense is embedded in mission-critical enterprise sales processes
2. Documented business outcomes create high switching costs
3. Expanding footprint to new business segments (wholesale, managed accounts)
4. Strategic alignment with CEO's digital transformation agenda
5. No competitive signals detected

**Warning Signs to Monitor:**
- Leadership changes (especially CTO, VP Enterprise)
- Major cost-cutting announcements affecting technology vendors
- RFPs for CPQ or order management systems
- Reduced engagement with CloudSense account team

## EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES

### Identified Opportunities

| Opportunity | Potential Value | Probability | Timeline | Rationale |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| **Wholesale Segment Expansion** | $150-250K | 70% | 6-12 months | Already in progress per CloudSense case study |
| **Managed Accounts Expansion** | $100-200K | 70% | 6-12 months | Already in progress per CloudSense case study |
| **Regional Enterprise (Philippines)** | $200-400K | 40% | 12-24 months | New MOU with TTI presents opportunity |
| **MyRepublic Integration** | $75-150K | 30% | 12-18 months | Post-acquisition systems integration |
| **Cybersecurity Services Quoting** | $50-100K | 25% | 12-24 months | Fastest growing segment may need enhanced capabilities |

**Total Expansion Potential:** $575K - $1.1M (over 24 months)

**Confidence Level:** MEDIUM (Based on publicly stated expansion plans and market dynamics)

### Strategic Recommendations

1. **Engage on Regional Expansion:** StarHub's Philippines partnership (TTI) represents a greenfield opportunity. Explore whether CloudSense can support their regional enterprise growth.

2. **MyRepublic Integration Play:** The S$105M acquisition will require systems integration. Position CloudSense for any B2B/SMB quoting needs for the MyRepublic brand.

3. **Cybersecurity Services Enhancement:** With 17-20% YoY growth in cybersecurity, this segment may need more sophisticated quoting capabilities for complex security bundles.
