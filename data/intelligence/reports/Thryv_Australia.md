## Executive Summary

Thryv Australia Pty Ltd is CloudSense's **#20 ranked customer** representing a **unique strategic profile** - a SaaS company serving the SMB market that itself uses CloudSense for enterprise sales operations. With **$567,979 ARR** (1.7% of CloudSense portfolio) and **100% recurring revenue**, this account demonstrates stable engagement but requires strategic attention given Thryv's ongoing business transformation.

### Overall Health Score: 6.5/10

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Product Engagement | 6/10 | Single subscription, stable but limited footprint |
| Financial Health | 7/10 | Parent company (NASDAQ: THRY) showing SaaS revenue growth (+33% YoY), but managed decline in legacy business |
| Relationship Strength | 6/10 | Stable relationship; limited executive visibility |
| Expansion Potential | 5/10 | Limited - Thryv is SMB-focused, not a telco/media operator |
| Renewal Confidence | 7/10 | Stable; no immediate churn signals but monitor transformation impact |

### Key Findings

1. **CONTEXT:** Thryv Australia (formerly Sensis) operates a fundamentally different business model than typical CloudSense customers. They are an SMB software platform, not a telecommunications operator, creating a potential product-market fit question.

2. **POSITIVE:** Parent company Thryv Holdings (NASDAQ: THRY) reported strong Q3 2025 results with SaaS revenue up 33% YoY to $115.9M. Company is successfully transitioning from legacy Yellow Pages/Marketing Services to cloud-based SMB software.

3. **CAUTION:** Thryv is executing a strategic pivot to exit Marketing Services by 2028 and consolidate on a single SaaS platform. This transformation could create budget pressure or technology stack rationalization.

4. **OPPORTUNITY:** Thryv serves 100,000+ SMB customers in Australia and has complex B2B product configuration needs for their enterprise sales motion. CloudSense may have expansion potential in their enterprise sales operations.

## Product-Market Fit Analysis

### Why Thryv Uses CloudSense (Hypothesis)

Given Thryv's business model as an **SMB SaaS provider** rather than a telecommunications operator, the CloudSense use case likely involves:

| Potential Use Case | Likelihood | Rationale |
|--------------------|------------|-----------|
| **Enterprise Sales CPQ** | High | Thryv has complex B2B product configuration for their enterprise/partner sales |
| **Partner Channel Management** | Medium | Thryv works with resellers and partners requiring quote/order management |
| **Product Configuration** | High | Multiple Thryv products/tiers require configuration logic |
| **Contract Management** | Medium | Subscription management for enterprise accounts |

### Product Fit Assessment

**Alignment with CloudSense Core Capabilities:**

| CloudSense Capability | Thryv Alignment | Score |
|----------------------|-----------------|-------|
| Telecom B2B CPQ | Low - Not a telco | 3/10 |
| Complex Product Configuration | Medium - SaaS tiers | 6/10 |
| Salesforce Native | Unknown - Thryv has own CRM | 5/10 |
| Order Management | Medium - Enterprise sales | 6/10 |
| BSS/OSS Integration | Low - Not applicable | 2/10 |

**Overall Product-Market Fit Score: 5/10**

This suggests Thryv may be using CloudSense in a **non-traditional use case** compared to typical telco/media customers. Understanding the specific deployment and use case is critical for renewal strategy.

**Confidence Level:** Low-Medium - Hypothesis based on business model analysis; requires validation.

## Technology Stack Analysis

### Thryv Platform Technology

| Layer | Technology | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| **Core Platform** | Thryv proprietary | Cloud-based SMB software |
| **CRM** | Thryv Business Center | Proprietary (also sells Keap) |
| **Payments** | ThryvPay | Integrated payment processing |
| **Marketing** | Thryv Marketing Automation | Proprietary |
| **Integrations** | Zapier, native APIs | QuickBooks, PayPal, Stripe, etc. |

### Key Integration Ecosystem

Thryv integrates with:
- QuickBooks (accounting)
- PayPal (payments)
- Instagram (social)
- WordPress (websites)
- Stripe (payments)
- Yelp (reviews)
- Twitter (social)
- Zoom (video)
- Gmail (email)
- Square (payments)
- JotForm (forms)

### Technology Implications for CloudSense

**Observation:** Thryv operates its own CRM and marketing automation platform. They are **not** a Salesforce customer in the traditional sense.

**Questions to Validate:**
1. Is CloudSense deployed on a separate Salesforce instance for enterprise sales?
2. Is CloudSense integrated with Thryv's proprietary platform?
3. What is the specific use case driving the $568K ARR engagement?

**Confidence Level:** Medium - Based on public technology documentation.

**Confidence Level:** Medium - Based on market analysis.
