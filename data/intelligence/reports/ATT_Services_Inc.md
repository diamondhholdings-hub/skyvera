| Subscription ID | End Customer | ARR | End Date | Renewal Qtr | Status |
|-----------------|--------------|-----|----------|-------------|--------|
| 1211972 | AT&T SERVICES, INC. (direct) | $1,798,095 | Feb 28, 2026 | Q1'26 | **Yes** (Renewing) |
| 1248555 | Community Health Systems | $682,730 | Feb 28, 2026 | Q1'26 | **Yes** (Renewing) |

| 1248553 | Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan | $13,191 | Feb 28, 2026 | Q1'26 | **No** (Churning) |
| 1329832 | AT&T SERVICES, INC. | $7,239 | Jul 31, 2026 | Q3'26 | **BU Decision Required** |
| 1248559 | Electrolux | $1,900 | Feb 28, 2026 | Q1'26 | **Yes** (Renewing) |

**Total ARR:** $2,518,275
**Renewing ARR (Q1'26):** $2,497,845 (99.2%)
**Churning ARR (Q1'26):** $13,191 (0.5%)

### Revenue Concentration Analysis

| Metric | Value | Risk Level |
|--------|-------|------------|
| AT&T as % of Kandy Q1'26 RR | 75.8% | **CRITICAL** |
| AT&T as % of Kandy FY25 RR | ~18% | HIGH |
| Subscription tenure | 3 years (since Mar 2023) | Moderate |

**Concentration Risk Assessment:** AT&T represents an extreme concentration risk for the Kandy business unit. Loss of this single customer would reduce Kandy's quarterly revenue by approximately $630K and require 2-3 replacement customers of similar size.

### Payment Behavior

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| AR > 90 Days | $58,313 | LOW (2.3% of ARR) |
| Payment Rating | Strong | Minimal collection risk |

**Confidence Level: HIGH** - Based on internal AR Aging data.

## STRATEGIC CONTEXT

### AT&T's Enterprise Communications Strategy

AT&T is undergoing a fundamental strategic transformation focused on:

1. **Fiber/5G Convergence:** $20B+ annual infrastructure investment targeting 40M+ fiber locations by end of 2026 (Source: AT&T Q4 2025 earnings)

2. **Business Wireline Decline:** Legacy enterprise services declining 10-20%+ annually. Q4'25 Business Wireline revenue was $5.1B, down 10.3% YoY. AT&T guided Legacy revenue to decline 20%+ in 2026.

3. **Cost Reduction:** Targeting $4B in annual cost savings by 2028. Workforce reduced from ~250K to ~150K over five years.

4. **Partner Solutions:** Chad Townes now leads AT&T Partner Solutions, overseeing indirect channels including white-label partnerships like Kandy.

### Relevance to Kandy Relationship

**Key Insight:** AT&T's strategic pivot away from Business Wireline creates both **risk** and **opportunity** for Kandy:

**RISK:** The CPaaS/white-label business may be considered "legacy" within AT&T's portfolio. If AT&T categorizes Kandy as part of declining Business Wireline services, the relationship could face:
- Budget cuts under cost reduction initiatives
- Strategic deprioritization vs. fiber/5G investments
- Potential vendor consolidation

**OPPORTUNITY:** AT&T continues to invest in UCaaS and CPaaS for enterprise customers. AT&T's Office@Hand UCaaS platform and Web Essentials (Braidio powered by Kandy) represent ongoing commitment to embedded communications. Kandy could expand if positioned as enabling AT&T's "next-gen" enterprise connectivity strategy.

**Confidence Level: MEDIUM** - Based on public earnings calls and industry analysis; internal AT&T strategic decisions are not visible.

---

## KEY FINDINGS

### 1. Massive Concentration Risk (CRITICAL)

AT&T represents 75.8% of Kandy's Q1'26 recurring revenue. This concentration creates existential risk for the Kandy BU:

- **Impact of full churn:** Would reduce Kandy quarterly revenue from $3.32M to ~$804K
- **Impact on Kandy margins:** Current 63.2% net margin would be severely compressed due to fixed cost allocation
- **Mitigation required:** Urgent customer diversification or AT&T relationship deepening

### 2. Q1'26 Renewal Window is ACTIVE

Five of six AT&T subscriptions expire February 28, 2026 (within 25 days). Current status:
- 4 subscriptions confirmed renewing ($2,497,845)
- 1 subscription churning (Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan - $13,191)
- 1 subscription pending decision ($7,239 in Q3'26)

**Immediate Action Required:** Confirm Q1'26 renewals are processed and invoiced before contract expiration.

### 3. AT&T's Business Wireline Decline Creates Uncertainty

AT&T's Business Wireline segment is declining at 10%+ annually, with guidance for 20%+ legacy revenue decline in 2026. If Kandy services are categorized as "legacy" within AT&T's procurement framework, the relationship faces headwinds.

**Key Questions:**
- How does AT&T internally categorize its Kandy spend?
- Is Kandy positioned as "legacy" or "next-gen connectivity"?
- Who is the economic buyer within AT&T Partner Solutions?

### 4. End-Customer Churn (Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan)

The BCBSM subscription ($13,191) is marked as "No" for renewal. This represents churn at the end-customer level of AT&T's reseller arrangement.

**Implications:**
- AT&T may have lost BCBSM as an enterprise customer entirely
- Or BCBSM may have migrated to a competing communications platform
- This is a leading indicator of potential erosion in AT&T's reseller channel

### 5. Strong Payment History

AT&T maintains low AR aging ($58K vs. $2.5M ARR = 2.3%), indicating:
- Healthy payment processes
- No immediate cash flow concern
- Relationship is operationally stable

---

## OPPORTUNITIES

### 1. Deepen AT&T Partnership ($500K-1M+ expansion potential)

**Rationale:** AT&T's strategic focus on converged fiber/5G and enterprise connectivity creates potential to position Kandy as a "next-gen" enabler rather than legacy service.

**Actions:**
- Engage Chad Townes (AT&T Partner Solutions) on roadmap alignment
- Propose integration with AT&T's 5G and fiber enterprise offerings
- Develop use cases for private 5G networks and edge computing communications

**Estimated Value:** $500K-1M+ ARR if Kandy captures incremental AT&T enterprise use cases

**Confidence Level: MEDIUM** - Depends on AT&T's internal strategic prioritization

### 2. Prevent End-Customer Churn

**Rationale:** BCBSM churn signals potential erosion in AT&T's enterprise customer base using Kandy services.

**Actions:**
- Request joint review with AT&T of at-risk end-customers
- Offer enhanced support for AT&T's enterprise customer success efforts
- Propose QBR (Quarterly Business Review) cadence with AT&T Partner Solutions

**Estimated Value:** Retention of $50K-200K in potential future churn

### 3. Geographic/Vertical Expansion

**Rationale:** AT&T's current Kandy subscriptions serve healthcare (Community Health Systems, BCBSM), retail (Hanes), and manufacturing (Electrolux). These represent proven use cases.

**Actions:**
- Develop vertical-specific case studies with AT&T
- Propose expanded healthcare communications (telehealth, patient engagement)
- Target AT&T's enterprise customers in financial services (not currently represented)

**Estimated Value:** $200K-500K incremental ARR over 12-18 months

---

## RISKS

### 1. Customer Concentration (CRITICAL - Probability: Ongoing)

**Risk:** Loss of AT&T would devastate Kandy BU economics.

**Mitigation:**
- Diversify Kandy customer base urgently (target 5+ customers at $500K+ ARR)
- Negotiate multi-year renewal with AT&T (3-year minimum)
- Include termination notice clauses (12+ months)

### 2. Strategic Deprioritization (HIGH - Probability: 40%)

**Risk:** AT&T categorizes Kandy as "legacy" and reduces investment/commitment.

**Mitigation:**
- Reposition Kandy as "Advanced Connectivity" aligned with AT&T's 2026-2028 strategy
- Engage executive sponsor within AT&T Partner Solutions
- Demonstrate value through usage metrics and customer success stories

### 3. Vendor Consolidation (MEDIUM - Probability: 25%)

**Risk:** AT&T consolidates CPaaS/UCaaS vendors under cost reduction program.

**Mitigation:**
- Differentiate on white-label capabilities and customization
- Emphasize switching costs and integration complexity
- Build relationships beyond procurement to business stakeholders

### 4. AT&T Workforce Reduction Impact (MEDIUM - Probability: 35%)

**Risk:** AT&T's ongoing workforce reduction (65,000 employees by end of 2025) may result in loss of key relationship contacts or budget authority changes.

**Mitigation:**
- Identify and map all stakeholders in AT&T Partner Solutions
- Build redundant relationships across multiple contacts
- Monitor AT&T organizational announcements for changes affecting Kandy relationship

### 5. End-Customer Erosion (MEDIUM - Probability: 30%)

**Risk:** Additional AT&T enterprise customers (beyond BCBSM) churn from Kandy-powered services.

**Mitigation:**
- Request end-customer usage analytics from AT&T
- Propose joint customer success program
- Develop early warning indicators for at-risk end-customers
