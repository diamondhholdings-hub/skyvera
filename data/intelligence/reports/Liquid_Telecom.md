### Strategic Health Score: 5.5/10

| Dimension | Score | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| **Product Engagement** | 7/10 | Active CloudSense CPQ user with TCS implementation |
| **Financial Health** | 4/10 | Credit downgrades, debt refinancing challenges |
| **Relationship Strength** | 6/10 | Established relationship, but leadership turnover |
| **Expansion Potential** | 6/10 | Multi-country operations offer geographic expansion |
| **Churn Risk** | 5/10 | MEDIUM-HIGH - Financial distress requires monitoring |

### Key Findings Summary

1. **CRITICAL RISK:** Liquid faces significant financial distress with Moody's downgrade to Caa2 and $620M debt maturing Feb/Sep 2026. This creates budget pressure and potential vendor consolidation risk.

2. **STRATEGIC VALUE:** Liquid is Africa's largest independent fiber network operator (110,000+ km) with operations in 20+ countries - a flagship reference customer for CloudSense in the African telecom market.

3. **REVENUE COMPOSITION INSIGHT:** NRR ($1.42M) exceeds RR ($1.07M), indicating active professional services engagement. This suggests ongoing expansion/customization work - a positive engagement signal but also dependency on project-based revenue.

4. **PLATFORM INVESTMENT:** Liquid has made significant investment in CloudSense through TCS-led implementation, migrating ~100,000 customer services to the platform. High switching costs work in our favor.

## 1. COMPANY INTELLIGENCE

### Business Overview

**Company Name:** Liquid Intelligent Technologies (formerly Liquid Telecom)
**Legal Entity:** Liquid Telecommunications Holdings Limited
**Parent Company:** Cassava Technologies
**Ultimate Owner:** Econet Group (Strive Masiyiwa, Founder & Executive Chairman)
**Headquarters:** Ebene, Mauritius (operational HQ in London)
**Founded:** 1997 (as Econet Satellite Services), incorporated 2007
**Industry:** Telecommunications, Digital Infrastructure, Cloud Services

### Business Model

Liquid operates a diversified digital infrastructure business model with four revenue pillars:

| **Network** | Long-haul metro networks, roaming services | Core infrastructure |
| **C2 (Liquid C2)** | Cloud services, managed services, cybersecurity | Growth driver |
| **Dataport** | Undersea assets, international wholesale, VSAT | Strategic connectivity |
| **Voice Traffic** | International voice interconnects between MNOs and carriers | Legacy revenue |

**Business Model Shift:** CFO Kate Hennessy noted the company has "shifted revenue mix toward recurring or annuity revenues characteristic of a typical technology firm." This strategic pivot aligns well with CloudSense's subscription management capabilities.

### Financial Performance

| Metric | FY25 (Feb 2025) | FY24 (Feb 2024) | Change |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|--------|
| **Total Revenue** | $693.5M | $686.7M | +1.0% |
| **Operating Profit** | $140.3M | $142.2M | -1.3% |
| **Net Profit** | $18.4M | $5.3M | +247.2% |
| **Operating Cash Flow** | $199.0M | $124.6M | +59.7% |
| **Net Debt/EBITDA** | 3.45x | N/A | Near covenant (3.50x) |

**Confidence Level:** HIGH - Data from audited financial statements and press releases

### Financial Challenges (CRITICAL)

Liquid is experiencing significant financial distress:

- **Credit Rating:** Moody's downgraded to Caa2 (November 2025) - "very high credit risk"
- **Debt Maturity:** $620M senior secured notes (5.5% coupon) due Feb/Sep 2026
- **Equity Raise:** Targeting $185M equity raise; only $60M secured to date
- **Refinancing:** $220M South African Rand term loan refinanced (Dec 2024)
- **Strategic Investments:** NVIDIA equity investment received; Google invested Dec 2024

**Implication for CloudSense:** Budget scrutiny will be intense. Any renewal discussions must demonstrate clear ROI and operational necessity.
