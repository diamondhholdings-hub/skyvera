---

## 1. CRITICAL FINANCIAL ISSUES

### ISSUE #1: FY'25 EBITDA Test Status
**Assessment: PASSED (with concerns)**

Based on the data extracted, the FY'25 EBITDA figures show:
- **FY'25 Net Profit (Current Hybrid Plan):** $35.86M
- **FY'25 Net Margin:** 56.9%
- **Margin Target:** 55.1%
- **Delta to Margin Target:** +$1.11M (positive, indicating compliance)

The EBITDA test appears to have PASSED based on the latest hybrid plan data. However, the "FAILED" note in CLAUDE.md may refer to the BU Plan vs. internal targets. The margin compression in later quarters (Q3-Q4) shows declining performance that warrants close monitoring.

### ISSUE #2: Margin Gap of -$918K (Q1'26)
**Root Cause Analysis:**

| Factor | Impact | Explanation |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| RR Decline | -$336K | Recurring revenue down vs. prior plan |
| HC COGS Increase | +$779K | Headcount COGS up significantly |
| NHC Expenses Up | +$177K | Non-headcount expenses increased |
| CF Expenses Up | +$107K | Cash flow/vendor expenses increased |
| **Total Margin Gap** | **-$918K** | 6.2 percentage points below target |

### ISSUE #3: Recurring Revenue Declining (-$336K)
**Breakdown by Business Unit:**

| Business Unit | Q1'26 Plan | Prior Plan | Variance |
|--------------|------------|------------|----------|
| Cloudsense | $6.37M | $6.72M | -$355K |
| Kandy | $3.32M | $3.40M | -$75K |
| STL | $0.80M | $0.66M | +$146K |
| **Total** | **$12.59M** | **$12.93M** | **-$336K** |

Cloudsense is the primary driver of RR decline, offset partially by STL growth.

## 5. VENDOR COST ANALYSIS

### Top Vendor Costs (Q1'26 Budget)

| Vendor | Q1'26 Cost | Annual Run Rate | % of Revenue | Business Unit |
|--------|------------|-----------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Salesforce UK Ltd** | ~$1,025,000 | **$4,100,000** | **6.9%** | Cloudsense |
| Agency Enterprise (AE Studio) | $404,242 | $2,041,599 | 2.7% | Cloudsense |
| Ribbon Communications | $158,769 | $635,076 | 1.1% | Kandy |
| Equinix Inc (Data Center US) | $96,000 | $384,000 | 0.7% | Kandy |
| Totogi | ~$100,000 | ~$400,000 | 0.7% | Cloudsense |
| IntelePeer Cloud | $36,000 | $144,000 | 0.2% | Kandy |
| Equinix UK (Data Center UK) | $25,500 | $102,000 | 0.2% | Kandy |

### CRITICAL FINDING: Salesforce UK Contract

**Contract Analysis:**
- **Annual Cost:** $4.1M
- **Q1'26 Cloudsense Revenue:** $6.4M RR + $1.7M NRR = $8.1M
- **Salesforce as % of Cloudsense Q1 Revenue:** 51% (annualized basis)
- **Salesforce as % of Cloudsense RR:** 64%

**Assessment:** This contract consumes 64% of Cloudsense's recurring revenue, representing significant concentration risk. If Cloudsense revenue declines further, the Salesforce contract becomes increasingly burdensome.

**Recommendation:** Urgent review of Salesforce UK contract terms, utilization, and renegotiation opportunities required.

### Vendor Spend by Business Unit (4Q Total FY'26)

| Business Unit | Q1-Q4'26 Total | Avg Quarterly |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| Cloudsense | $6,199,739 | $1,549,935 |
| Kandy | $1,993,731 | $498,433 |
| STL | $710,961 | $177,740 |
| VoltDelta | $157,902 | $39,475 |
| NewNet | $33,000 | $8,250 |
| **Total** | **$9,095,332** | **$2,273,833** |
