Phase 6, Plan 5 of 5 - Ready to execute final plan of the milestone.

**What this plan does**: Restyle the three secondary pages (Alerts, Scenario Modeling, Natural Language Query) and the root page with the editorial theme (Cormorant Garamond + DM Sans, Paper/Ink palette), then perform human verification of complete visual design.

**Current position**: Plan 06-05 has not been executed yet. All previous plans (01-04) are complete.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

**Phase 6 Plans Completed:**
- ✅ Plan 01: Design system foundation (CSS variables, Google Fonts, Tailwind config, shared components)
- ✅ Plan 02: Dashboard page editorial styling (gradient header, KPI cards, themed charts)
- ✅ Plan 03: Account directory card grid with hover effects
- ✅ Plan 04: Account plan pages hero header with sticky tabs

**Phases 1-5 Complete:**
- ✅ Phase 1: Foundation & Data Integration (4 plans)
- ✅ Phase 2: Core Platform UI (3 plans)
- ✅ Phase 3: Intelligence Features (2 plans)
- ✅ Phase 4: Advanced Account Intelligence (4 plans)
- ✅ Phase 5: Demo Readiness (4 plans)

Platform is fully functional. Phase 6 is pure visual enhancement.

<remaining_work>

**Plan 06-05 Tasks:**
1. Task 1: Alerts, Scenario, and Query pages editorial restyling
   - Restyle 13 files with editorial theme patterns
   - Apply gradient headers, editorial cards, accent buttons
   - Ensure consistent typography (Cormorant Garamond + DM Sans)

2. Task 2: Root page (landing) editorial styling
   - Apply editorial theme to root page.tsx

3. Task 3: CHECKPOINT - Human visual verification
   - User manually browses entire application
   - Verifies design consistency across all pages
   - Confirms match to reference design intent

**After Plan 06-05:**
- Phase 6 complete (milestone complete - this is the last phase)
- Run `/gsd:complete-milestone` to archive and prepare for next version
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

**Editorial Design System (from Plans 01-04):**
- Typography: Cormorant Garamond (display) + DM Sans (body)
- Color palette: Paper/Ink theme with --accent: #c84b31, --secondary: #2d4263
- CSS custom properties as single source of truth (10 variables)
- Gradient header pattern: bg-gradient-to-br from-secondary to-[#1a2332]
- Card grid over tables for executive presentation
- Border-left-4 pattern for alert severity with 10% opacity backgrounds

**Key Patterns Applied:**
- Headers use font-display class for serif titles
- Primary buttons: bg-accent text-white hover:bg-accent/90
- Form inputs: border-[var(--border)] focus:border-accent
- Alert cards: border-l-4 with --critical/--warning/--success colors
- Sticky tabs with accent underline (3px) for active state
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None. Plan is ready to execute.

**Unrelated uncommitted changes exist** (not blockers, just noise):
- package.json/package-lock.json modifications
- Prisma config changes
- product-agent test page changes
- Various untracked files (check-dashboard-error.js, etc.)

These are unrelated to Phase 6 work and should probably be cleaned up or committed separately.
</blockers>

<context>

**Mental Model:**
This is the final polish pass. The platform is fully functional - Phase 6 is purely about making it look professional and consistent with the reference HTML designs created earlier in the project (Skyvera_Executive_Dashboard.html, account HTML files).

The editorial theme (Paper/Ink palette, Cormorant Garamond serif headings) creates a distinctive executive presentation feel - moving away from generic SaaS blue/purple gradients to something more magazine-editorial.

**Reference Designs:**
- `/Users/RAZER/Documents/projects/Skyvera/Skyvera_Executive_Dashboard.html`
- `/Users/RAZER/Documents/projects/Skyvera/Skyvera_Executive_Intelligence_Report.html`
- `/Users/RAZER/Documents/projects/Skyvera/accounts/Telstra_Account_Plan_Interactive.html`
- `/Users/RAZER/Documents/projects/Skyvera/accounts/Liquid_Telecom_Account_Plan.html`

**Plan 06-05 Structure:**
- 3 tasks total
- Wave 2 execution (depends on Plan 01 foundation)
- autonomous: false (has checkpoint for human verification)
- Must-haves include human visual verification as requirement

**After Completion:**
This completes the entire v1.0 milestone (6 phases, 22 plans total). Ready for `/gsd:complete-milestone`.
</context>

<next_action>
**To resume work:**

```bash
cd /Users/RAZER/Documents/projects/Skyvera
/gsd:progress
```

This will show current state and route to:
```
/gsd:execute-phase 6
```

Which will execute Plan 06-05 (the only remaining plan).

**Alternative (if you remember the context):**
Just run `/gsd:execute-phase 6` directly to execute the final plan.

**Clean context approach:**
Run `/clear` first to start with fresh context window, then `/gsd:execute-phase 6`.
</next_action>

<files_modified>
None for Phase 6, Plan 5 yet (not executed).

Unrelated uncommitted changes present in working directory:
- package-lock.json
- package.json
- prisma.config.ts (deleted)
- prisma/schema.prisma
- src/app/product-agent/test-analysis/page.tsx
- Untracked: check-dashboard-error.js, scripts/seed-customers.ts, etc.

Consider reviewing these changes - they may be from exploratory work or experiments unrelated to the GSD roadmap.
